# GitHub Steps

Follow these steps to add, commit, and push changes to your GitHub repository:

1. **Add changes to the staging area:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

2. **Commit changes with a meaningful message:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "readme.md"
    ```

3. **Push changes to the main branch of your remote repository on GitHub:**
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

Make sure to replace `main` with the name of your branch if it's different.

That's it! Your changes are now pushed to your GitHub repository.
